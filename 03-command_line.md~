# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Command Line Crash Course
tutorial](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). This is a great,
quick tutorial. Each "chapter" focuses on a command. Type the commands
you see in the _Do This_ section, and read the _You Learned This_
section. Move on to the next chapter. You should be able to go through
these in a couple of hours.

What does `ls` do? What do `ls -a`, `ls -l`, and `ls -lh` do? What combinations of those flags are meaningful?
**ls** prints the files and directories in the working directory
**ls -a** also prints hidden files
**ls -l** prints files and directories as records each with six columns
**ls -lh** prints files in human-readable format in column form
I can imagine ls -lt is useful since it prints contents in column form sorted by modification time
The flag -a that prints hidden files is nice as well, and could be used with -t to print contents including hidden files sorted by modification time
